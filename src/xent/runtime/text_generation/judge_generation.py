    "Gothic Horror": "The decay of the house was not a thing of mere wood and stone, but a rot of the spirit, a creeping miasma of forgotten sorrows that had soaked into the very mortar, such that to breathe the air within its halls was to inhale the dust of long-dead resentments and the faint, cloying perfume of madness.",

    "Archaic Epic": "Hark, for in the age of ember and ash, when mountains were but babes, did the Sky-Titan forge the Sun-Hammer, its head a captive star, its haft the bone of a god, and with a single, resounding blow, did He strike the Anvil of Night, and from the sundered sparks were born the constellations.",
    "Stark Survival Log": "Day 27. The hunger is a dull ache now. Ate the last of the lichen yesterday. The wind never stops. Saw another set of tracks this morning, not animal. Larger. I have three cartridges left for the flare gun. I will not use them to signal.",

    "Court Transcript": "MR. HENDERSON: And can you tell the court, precisely, what you observed?\nWITNESS: I saw the defendant. He was... well, he was rearranging the garden gnomes.\nMR. HENDERSON: Rearranging them how?\nWITNESS: Into what appeared to be a diorama of a famous naval battle. I believe it was the Battle of Trafalgar. His attention to detail was impressive.",
    "Cyberpunk Jargon": "Just slotted a new firmware patch for my optic nerve. The KORP-issued ad-blocker was starting to glitch, letting targeted psych-ads bleed into my REM cycle.

    "Childrens Fable": "Barnaby the beetle had a very important coat with seven pockets. In the first pocket, he kept a crumb of sugar for emergencies.

    "Academic Abstract": 'This paper contests the prevailing historiographical interpretation of the "Great Silence" of the 14th century.

    "Hardboiled Detective": "The dame had eyes you could drown in and a story with more holes than a block of cheap swiss. She said her husband, a big-shot inventor, had vanished. Left nothing behind but a lingering scent of ozone and a single, perfectly spherical hole burned through his laboratory wall. Trouble was my business, and business was booming.",

    "Western Tall Tale": "Old Man Hemlock, he was so tough he used to floss his teeth with barbed wire and use a rattlesnake for a necktie. One time, a tornado came through his property.
